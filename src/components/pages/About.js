             Adept working within a team or individually, problem solving projects in a
             collaborative environment. I like the idea of taking an idea, whether itâ€™s
             in a group or solo, from concept to finished product. Delivering it to the
             client exceeding their expectations. Art has always been very exciting to me.
             Creating on a canvas or on a computer. For print or for the internet.
             Being creative and executing a top quality product is my foremost goal.</p>
